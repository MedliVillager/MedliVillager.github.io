          I love <span class="rainbow-text">Medli</span>, I love Animal Crossing. If you were to combine these two things, you'd be left with perfection! The smart folks over at <span style="color: red;">Nintendo</span> recognized how wonderful of an idea this was, and she was added to the game on <span style="color: yellow;">November 2nd, 2016</span> with the <span style="color: lime;">Welcome amiibo</span> update! But you don't need this website to tell you that, this happened years ago and is well documented! Then, why <strong><i>does</i></strong> this website even exist!?

          The person who wrote this probably had free healthcare and paid off their house with a pouch of salt and 2 silver coins. See, <span style="color: red;">Nintendo</span>, like all corporations, is beholden to its investors and therefore monetizes at all possible opportunities. This is great if you own their stock, but terrible if you want <span class="rainbow-text">Medli</span> on your island! As you may recall, <span class="rainbow-text">Medli</span> was added to New Leaf in the <span style="color: lime;">Welcome amiibo</span> update. This update changed a number of things about the game, but the feature relevant to what we're discussing today is the amiibo functionality it introduced to the game. By summoning the special character <span style="color: grey;">Wisp</span> through interacting with his lamp, you can scan an amiibo to either receive an item and 5 MEOW Coupons or have him take the form of the villager associated with the scanned amiibo. If you choose this option, the villager will move into the Campsite and can be convinced to move into your town! There's just one problem: the <i>only</i> way to get <span class="rainbow-text">Medli</span> is by using either the Toon Link or Toon Zelda amiibo! Unfortunately, I can't afford that. <span class="trans-text">Hormone replacement therapy</span> isn't gonna pay for itself!

          1: We meet up at the agreed upon location (social anxiety included!)
          <br>
          2: I open up Animal Crossing: New Leaf - Welcome amiibo and walk into my home.
          <br>
          3: After I interact with <span style="color: grey;">Wisp's</span> lamp, you pull out the Toon Link / Zelda amiibo and I scan it.
          <br>
          4: I go to <span class="rainbow-text">Medli's</span> RV and invite her to my town (immaculate rizz).
          <br>
          5: We part ways!

          <br>
          I go home with my favorite villager, you go home with a fun story to tell the ol' ball and chain! Fun, easy, and everyone wins!

          <i>
            <span style="font-family: 'VTPortableRemington', sans-serif; color: grey;">
              Bringing joy to my fellow human in this cruel world at minimal to no additional cost to myself is NOT ENOUGH FOR ME! I require, nay, DESIRE COMPENSATION!! GREED IS MY MIDDLE NAME, FORTE, AND SINGLE GREATEST DEFINING TRAIT!!!

          </i>
          <br>

            You're typing in the C.O.G.S. font because you're evil and twisted.

          As you may recall, I am broke so I can't offer you anything of real monetary value. But I can give you funny things which require no money! Such as:

            <br>
            Introducing you to my favorite Hatsune Miku modules! We love you Miku!

          <br>
          And (not) many more! But remember, your assistance in my pursuit of happiness is truly the greatest payment of them all. Hit me up!
